# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition Neural Network ✍️



## 🌟 Overview

This project focuses on building a **Neural Network** to recognize handwritten digits using **TensorFlow** and the **MNIST** dataset. The model is designed to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) into the correct category, making it a fundamental project in machine learning and computer vision. The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks, containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits, making it an ideal dataset for training and testing.

The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network that can achieve high accuracy on this classification task, leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The neural network model is built using **TensorFlow** and includes the following layers:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts 28x28 pixel images (grayscale) as input.
- **Flatten Layer**: Flattens the 28x28 pixel input into a 784-dimensional vector.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation to learn non-linear relationships.
- **Dropout Layer**: Applied during training to prevent overfitting.
- **Output Layer**: Uses a Softmax activation function to output probabilities for each digit class (0-9).

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
